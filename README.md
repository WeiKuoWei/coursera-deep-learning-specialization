# coursera-deep-learning-specialization
This repository are a selection of the projects I did for the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.   
Those projects are done in Python and in Tensorflow, and ranges from simple logistic regression to Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.
