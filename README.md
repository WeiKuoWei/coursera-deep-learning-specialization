# coursera-deep-learning-specialization
This repository are a selection of the projects I did for the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.   
Those projects are done in Python and in Tensorflow, and ranges from simple logistic regression to Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.  
Below are the 6 certificates I got for completing the specialization.
